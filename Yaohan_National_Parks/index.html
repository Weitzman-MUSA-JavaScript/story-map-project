          <h2>Worldwide National Parks</h2>
          <p>A national park is a protected area designated for conservation due to its exceptional natural, historical, or cultural significance at the national level. It may consist of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that is owned and managed by the government.</p>
          <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature defines national parks, and over 150 countries around the world have designated such lands. Globally, there are more than 3,100 national parks, with Australia having the most, totaling 685. However, the United States is home to the world's first national park. The following slide will continue to explore the national parks in the United States.</p>

          <h2>National Parks in the USA</h2>
          <p>The 431 units of the National Park System are often broadly referred to as national parks, although most of them have other formal designations. Strictly speaking, the United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas managed by the National Park Service, a division of the Department of the Interior.</p>
          <p>The first national park, Yellowstone, was established when President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law in 1872. This was followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (later decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (which was later incorporated into the National Capital Parks), Sequoia, and Yosemite in 1890. The national parks set a record in 2021, attracting more than 92 million visitors.</p>

          <h2>Yellowstone National Park</h2>
          <p>Yellowstone National Park is a national park in the United States, primarily located in the northwest corner of Wyoming, extending into Montana and Idaho. It spans an area of 8,983 square kilometers, featuring lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake, one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America, is situated over the Yellowstone Caldera, the continent's largest supervolcano. The park was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress through the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872.</p>
          <p>Yellowstone has over 1,449 kilometers of hiking trails, most of which are managed as wilderness areas. Many of the park's trails are located at altitudes above 2,100 meters, so snow often persists until late May or early June. In some areas, especially mountain passes, snow can remain until late July. As a result, many trails require crossing cold and potentially hazardous rivers. Be sure to check the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/situationreport.htm" target="_blank">Backcountry Conditions</a> page for the latest trail information.</p>
