        <h1>Philadelphia Ethnic Food Clusters</h1>
        <p>Moving off of the University of Pennsylvania's campus during the Covid-19 pandemic, I found myself in a drastically different food environment.</p>
        <p>In my new neighborhood of Spruce Hill, Philadelphia, I discovered the succulent chicken sandwiches at Saad's Halal Restaurant, the tender lamb leg at Hadramout, and discovered a wealth of other middle eastern and halal eateries.</p>
        <p>As a spatial data enthusiast, this led me to wonder how the ethnic food landscape of Philadelphia varies across geographies.</p>
        <p>This storymap documents what I've found through a year of research and data collection from Yelp's Fusion API and the Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia.</p>

        <h2>Philadelphia Restaurants, according to Yelp</h2>
        <p>I identified Yelp as the most up-to-date and granular source of information on open restaurants, due to the business incentive for restaurants to keep their listings current. Yelp also relies on crowdsourcing to verify whether businesses are still open.</p>
        <p>In total, there are 2,288 total ethnic restaurants in Philadelphia based on Yelp's Fusion API. Using their description fields and names, I keyword mapped cuisines for restaurants.</p>
        <p>Following is the frequency of the cuisine categories in the city.</p>
